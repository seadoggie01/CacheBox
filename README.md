# CacheBox

An application to back your files up.

Featuring:

    Folder Selection: Any folder or network location can be used

    Multi Select: Need just a few folders backed up, got you covered
  
    Offline? Edited files will be backed up as soon as you reconnect to your network
  
    Fancy "full" backups: Files that haven't been edited won't be backed up if they already exist
  
    Cool colors: select your favorite color theme for the options menu
  
    Automatic launch: open CacheBox on startup
  
  
More to come! Post your ideas with the 'Feature' tag in Issues!
